- Models	 
- User
- Tracks
- Playlists

Users can view tracks and create playlists of existing links in the db, as well as posting links of their tracks to the db. Upon reaching the site, they will see a login / password prompt, with successful login, they will be taken to their homepage.  The User’s homepage will display three separate lists, one of the available tracks on the db, one of tracks the user created/uploaded, and a third of the playlists the user has created. Below this there will be buttons prompting the user to upload track, and to create new playlists using available tracks in the database. 

When the user goes to a track, the track details will show who uploaded the track, as well as which playlists it is on. The seed tracks I include will be included as one playlist. 


Stretch 1: A user can upload a playlist of several tracks at once. 
Stretch 2: Every Track has a separate model of “Artist” attached to it.
